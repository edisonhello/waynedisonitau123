Given $x \equiv a_i \mod n_i \forall 1 \leq i \leq k$, where $n_i$ are pairwise coprime, find x. \\
Let $N = \prod_{i = 1}^{k}{n_i}$ and $N_i = N / n_i$, there exist integer $M_i$ and $m_i$ such that $M_iN_i + m_in_i = 1$. \\
A solution to the system of congruence is $x = \sum_{i = 1}^{k}{a_iM_iN_i}$.
