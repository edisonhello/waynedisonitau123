\begin{itemize}
  \item Given a degree sequence $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$ for each labeled vertices, there're $\frac{(n - 2)!}{(d_1 - 1)!(d_2 - 1)!\cdots(d_n - 1)!}$ spanning trees.
  \item Let $T_{n, k}$ be the number of labeled forests on $n$ vertices with $k$ components, such that vertex $1, 2, \ldots, k$ belong to different components. Then $T_{n, k} = kn^{n - k - 1}$.
\end{itemize}
